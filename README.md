# Azure SaaS Reference Application

## Podcastr
 Podcastr is a reference application built to showcase many of the constructs that Independent Software Vendor(ISV) have to address when building a Software-as-a-Service(SaaS) solution on Azure.  It is based on best practices that the Fast Track For Azure team has acquired through engaging with ISVs and Startups to help them bring their products to Azure.

 ## Solution Overview
 Podcastr is a SaaS solution that provides end-to-end management of podcasts including episodes, guests, sponsors, podcast audio processing(transcription and translation),and search.
